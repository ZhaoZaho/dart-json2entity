# Convert json to entity class like GsonFormat for Java

As a freshman for Flutter, I need a json-to-entity converter for Dart, So I write this poor toolã€‚
It's simple BUT HELPFUL.

## Feature

-   Input json, output entity class file in Dart language.
-   support json_serializable
    U need do this by yourself:`flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

## How to use

dart json2bean.dart

## Coming later

-   command line parameter support
